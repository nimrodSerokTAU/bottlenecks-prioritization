## This Repository contains the code needed to perform Bottlenecks analysis

Each one of the stages creates an output which is the input of the next stage. The first stage, **CalculateBottlenecks**,
contains examples of input and output. Each stage contains its own explenation.

1. Use **CalculateBottlenecks** first, to calculate the bottlenecks according to your data.
2. Use **SeconderyAnalysis** to perform analysis of links and trunks.
3. Use **AnalyzeResults** to create graphs from the data.
